### Immeditaely, we notice the following:
### How many values in each section are missing: Country:197, reporting.date: 1, summary: 5, gender: 183, age: 242, symptom_onset: 522
### If_onset_approximated: 525, hosp_visit_date: 578, exposure_start: 957, exposure_end: 744, from.Wuhan: 4, symptom: 815

#Death is 0 value if the person didn't die, 1 if they did, however some listed it as a date so we need to fix that

covid19$deathnew <- as.integer(covid19$death!= 0) #Clean death
unique(covid19$deathnew) #Checking if resulting values are either 0 or 1
#death rate
sum(covid19$deathnew)/nrow(covid19)*100
#Death rate is 5.806%

## an issue with this dataset is that 
#Recovered is 0 value if the person recover, 1 if they did, however some listed it as a date so we need to fix that

covid19$recoverednew <- as.integer(covid19$recovered!= 0)
unique(covid19$recoverednew)
sum(covid19$recoverednew)/nrow(covid19)*100
#Recovery rate is 14.654%

#We can see a discrepancy in the age groups and genders of those who survived, however, we have to test if it is statistically significant. 
# Testing significance of theory that survivors average age is younger than those who died:
t.test(alive$age, dead$age, alternative= "two.sided", conf.level = 0.99)
    #Welch Two Sample t-test
    
    # data:  alive$age and dead$age
    # t = -10.839, df = 72.234, p-value < 2.2e-16
    # alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
    # 99 percent confidence interval:
    #  -25.52122 -15.50661
    # sample estimates:
    #    mean of x        mean of y 
    #    48.07229         68.58621 

# p-value is < 0.05, therefore, we reject the null hypothesis. This test proves that there is a statistical significance in the argument that the average age of survivors is younger than that of the dead. 

#Previously, we only used tables to see the statistics between genders in survival and deaths. 
# T-Test to see significance of gender in deaths and survivors:
men = subset(covid19, gender = "male")
women = subset(covid19, gender = "female")

      # data:  men$deathnew and women$deathnew
      # t = 0, df = 2168, p-value = 1
      # alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
      # 99 percent confidence interval:

      #   0.05806452         0.05806452 
# p-value is > 0.05, therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that there are significantly more men who die from covid than women.
# Gender has no statistical significance in survivors of COVID-19
